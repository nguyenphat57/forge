# Forge Antigravity - Core Orchestrator

> Forge = delivery discipline + skill composition + evidence before claims.
> Forge must be strong and disciplined enough even if the repo does not have any companion skills or local skills.
> Forge is flexible on small tasks and disciplined on medium and large tasks.

---

## Bundle Layout

The tree below reflects the Antigravity bundle after overlaying this adapter on top of `forge-core`.
Files inherited from core and files added by the adapter both appear in a single runtime layout.

- `SKILL.md`: entrypoint to route intent, pair skills, and hold delivery guardrails
- `workflows/design/`: planning, architecture, spec-review, visualize
- `workflows/execution/`: build, debug, test, review, refactor, secure, deploy, session
- `workflows/operator/`: help, next, run, bump, rollback, and Antigravity wrappers like customize/init/recap/save-brain/handover
- `domains/`: core domain guidance for frontend and backend
- `data/`: machine-readable registry for intent, matrix, verification profiles, quality profiles, execution pipelines, and lane model policy
- `scripts/`: deterministic tooling for route preview, scoped continuity capture, and optional checks for workspaces with local layers
- `tests/`: regression tests for deterministic scripts and router/tooling contracts
- `references/`: smoke tests, companion contract, and read-only reference documentation when needed
- `agents/openai.yaml`: UI metadata for hosts that support skill list/chips

## Host Boundary

- Antigravity host rules live at a scope above this folder.
- The root `GEMINI.md` at Antigravity scope, if the host is using it, is a **host rule file** and not part of this skill bundle.
- `AGENTS.md` at the workspace root is a **router/instruction file** for the workspace, not `SKILL.md`.
- `forge-antigravity` may read host/workspace rules for better routing, but does not depend on a local `GEMINI.md` inside this skill folder.

## Independence Rule

- Forge is a **global-first orchestrator**.
- New repos, small repos, or repos without local skills must still use Forge normally through the workflows/domain skills of this bundle.
- Companion skills and workspace routers are **optional augmentation**, not default dependencies.
- If there is no clear companion/local skill, Forge must not hesitate or wait for a "full skill set" before working.

---

## Executable Tooling

- Canonical machine-readable source: `data/orchestrator-registry.json`
- Preferences resolver: `scripts/resolve_preferences.py` (adapter-global Forge preferences -> canonical response-style contract, with optional legacy workspace fallback)
- Preferences writer: `scripts/write_preferences.py` (canonical schema persistence for `/customize`)
- Workspace init skeleton: `scripts/initialize_workspace.py` (repo-neutral bootstrap for `/init`)
- Help/next navigator: `scripts/resolve_help_next.py` (repo state -> current focus, suggested workflow, next action)
- Run guidance resolver: `scripts/run_with_guidance.py` (execute command -> classify signal -> route to test/debug/deploy)
- Error translator: `scripts/translate_error.py` (raw stderr/error text -> sanitized human summary + suggested action)
- Bump preparation: `scripts/prepare_bump.py` (explicit or inferred semver bump -> update VERSION/CHANGELOG checklist)
- Rollback planner: `scripts/resolve_rollback.py` (scope/risk -> safest recovery strategy + verification)
- Deterministic route preview: `scripts/route_preview.py` (intent + chain + execution pipeline + lane model tiers)
- Workspace router drift check: `scripts/check_workspace_router.py` (only used when the workspace actually has a local routing layer)

- UI brief generator for frontend/visualize work: `scripts/generate_ui_brief.py`
- UI brief checker for persisted frontend/visualize artifacts: `scripts/check_ui_brief.py`

  - `.forge-artifacts/router-checks/`
  - `.forge-artifacts/backend-briefs/`
  - `.forge-artifacts/chain-status/`
  - `.forge-artifacts/execution-progress/`

  - `.brain/decisions.json`
  - `.brain/learnings.json`

For detailed command examples or artifact behavior, read `references/tooling.md`.

---

## Response Personalization

- Forge resolves preferences through the core engine `scripts/resolve_preferences.py` from the Antigravity-global split state: canonical fields in `state/preferences.json`, adapter extras in `state/extra_preferences.json`, and only falls back to `.brain/preferences.json` for workspace legacy.
- Canonical schema includes `technical_level`, `detail_level`, `autonomy_level`, `pace`, `feedback_style`, and `personality`.
- When the state file contains an Antigravity native legacy payload, this adapter only maps that payload to the canonical schema for reading or migration; the steady-state write path remains the split-file canonical + extras from core.
- `forge-antigravity` ships compat defaults so that a clean install resolves `language=vi` and `orthography=vietnamese_diacritics` by default until state or workspace overrides them.
- `forge-antigravity` may add wrappers like `/customize`, but schema and response-style semantics must still be read from core.
- Durable preference updates, including `language` and `orthography`, must go through `scripts/write_preferences.py`; workspace `.brain/preferences.json` is only for per-repo overrides or legacy fallback.
- Host UX may be richer than Codex, but must not fork key names or validation rules.

---

## Operator Guidance

- `forge-antigravity` may explicitly expose `/help` and `/next`, but guidance must still resolve from the core navigator `scripts/resolve_help_next.py`.
- Repo-first remains a hard rule: `git status`, plans/specs, then `.brain`.
- Wrapper UX may be more operator-friendly, but must not turn guidance into recap theater.
- `forge-antigravity` may explicitly expose `/run`, but results must still resolve from the core `scripts/run_with_guidance.py`.
- Error translation still reads from the core helper `scripts/translate_error.py`; this adapter only changes presentation, not the pattern database.
- `/bump` and `/rollback` may be explicitly exposed in Antigravity, but must still maintain the user-requested/inference-justified and risk-first contract of core.
- `/init` may be richer in onboarding, but the reusable workspace skeleton must still go through `scripts/initialize_workspace.py`.
- Session ergonomics wrappers like `/recap`, `/save-brain`, and `/handover` are convenience surfaces on top of `workflows/execution/session.md`.
- These wrappers may be richer in UX, but must not change `state`, `command_kind`, or `suggested_workflow` from core.

---

## Antigravity Operator Surface

Primary wrappers:

| Surface | Wrapper | Core contract |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| `/help` | `workflows/operator/help.md` | `scripts/resolve_help_next.py --mode help` |
| `/next` | `workflows/operator/next.md` | `scripts/resolve_help_next.py --mode next` |
| `/run` | `workflows/operator/run.md` | `scripts/run_with_guidance.py` |
| `/bump` | `workflows/operator/bump.md` | `scripts/prepare_bump.py` |
| `/rollback` | `workflows/operator/rollback.md` | `scripts/resolve_rollback.py` |
| `/customize` | `workflows/operator/customize.md` | `scripts/resolve_preferences.py` + `scripts/write_preferences.py` |
| `/init` | `workflows/operator/init.md` | `scripts/initialize_workspace.py` |

Session wrappers:

| Alias | Wrapper | Core contract |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `/recap` | `workflows/operator/recap.md` | `workflows/execution/session.md` restore mode |
| `/save-brain` | `workflows/operator/save-brain.md` | `workflows/execution/session.md` save mode |
| `/handover` | `workflows/operator/handover.md` | `workflows/execution/session.md` handover mode |

Compatibility rules:

- Aliases exist only to reduce migration friction, not to create new intents.
- Wrapper docs may be more operator-friendly, but deterministic semantics must still be read from core.
- Detailed mapping: `references/antigravity-operator-surface.md`.

---

## Intent Detection

When receiving a prompt from the user, classify the intent:

| Intent | Trigger keywords | Example |
|--------|------------------|---------|
| **BUILD** | add, create, implement, feature, code | "Add payment feature" |
| **DEBUG** | error, bug, fix, crash | "Fix login failure" |
| **OPTIMIZE** | refactor, optimize, clean, tidy | "Refactor overly long file" |
| **DEPLOY** | deploy, release, production, rollout | "Deploy to Vercel" |
| **REVIEW** | review, evaluate, check, audit | "Review code before merge" |
| **VISUALIZE** | ui, ux, mockup, wireframe, screen, layout | "Sketch checkout screen" |
| **SESSION** | recap, continue, resume, save, context | "Continue unfinished work" |

**When user uses `/shortcut`:** Map according to the shortcut registry of the Antigravity host, not dependent on local files in this skill folder.
Canonical source for intent keywords and chains: `data/orchestrator-registry.json`.

Signals like `brainstorm`, `options`, `approach`, `tradeoff` do not create new intents; they activate the **brainstorm gate** before `plan` when the task is ambiguous/complex enough.

---

## Complexity Assessment

| Level | Criteria | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **small** | <=2 files, small blast radius, clear requirements | Fix typo, edit CSS, change 1 field |
| **medium** | 3-10 files, behavioral change or needs assumption | Add filter, CRUD endpoint |
| **large** | >10 files or new feature/module, wide data flow | Payment, auth flow, new module |

When in doubt between small and medium -> default to **medium**.
Canonical source for hints and thresholds: `data/orchestrator-registry.json`.

---

## Skill Composition Matrix

Intent + Complexity -> skills to load:

| Intent | small | medium | large |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| **BUILD** | `build` | `plan` -> `build` -> `test` -> `quality-gate` | `plan` -> `architect` -> `spec-review` -> `build` -> `test` -> `quality-gate` |
| **DEBUG** | `debug` | `debug` -> `test` | `debug` -> `plan` -> `build` -> `test` |
| **OPTIMIZE** | `refactor` | `refactor` -> `test` | `review` -> `refactor` -> `test` |
| **DEPLOY** | `deploy` | `secure` -> `quality-gate` -> `deploy` | `secure` -> `test` -> `quality-gate` -> `deploy` |
| **REVIEW** | `review` | `review` -> `secure` | `review` -> `secure` |
| **VISUALIZE** | `visualize` | `plan` -> `visualize` | `plan` -> `architect` -> `visualize` |
| **SESSION** | `session` | `session` | `session` |

**Ambiguity gate:** For `BUILD` or `VISUALIZE` at medium/large, if the prompt is ambiguous or weighing multiple approaches, insert `brainstorm` before `plan`. `Brainstorm` must not just list options; it must lock a recommendation strong enough for `plan` to inherit, or record exactly one missing decision question.
**Spec-review gate:** For `BUILD large`, or `BUILD medium` touching contract/schema/migration/auth/payment/public interface/high-risk boundary, insert `spec-review` before `build`.
**Execution pipeline gate:** For large `BUILD/DEBUG/OPTIMIZE` or profiles stronger than `standard`, add an independent reviewer lane by default; for `BUILD` with `spec-review`, lean towards the `implementer -> spec-reviewer -> quality-reviewer` pipeline.
**Lane model policy:** Use abstract tiers `cheap / standard / capable` per lane instead of pushing every step to the same capacity level.

**Domain skills** (`frontend`, `backend`) are added when the task involves UI or API/database/service layer.
**Companion runtime/language skills** (Python, Java, Go, .NET, framework-specific) are optional augmentation when the repo/framework is already known. Forge must still work fine without them.
Companion skill contract: see `references/companion-skill-contract.md` when you are actually adding a runtime/framework layer.
If the workspace has `AGENTS.md` or a router doc pointing to local skills, use that router as the source-of-truth for this extension layer; if not, Forge continues with its own bundle.
To preview deterministic routing for a specific prompt: run `scripts/route_preview.py`.

### How to load skills

```
1. Detect intent + complexity
2. Look up matrix -> list of Forge skills needed
3. Choose execution pipeline and lane model tiers if the task is large/risky enough
4. Choose a Forge chain sufficient to solve the task with this bundle
5. Check repo signals (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `*.csproj`, ...)
6. If a suitable companion skill exists and genuinely increases accuracy -> add it to the chain
7. If the workspace has a router doc for local skills -> use it as an extension layer, do not replace Forge
8. Notify user: "Forge: [intent] | [complexity] | Skills: [list]"
9. Load the first skill
10. Complete the important quality gate
11. Move to the next skill only if needed
```

No need to fully load the chain if the task was safely resolved earlier.
Companion/local skills must not override Forge's verification/evidence gates.

**Minimal routing policy:** For `REVIEW`, `SESSION`, and `small` tasks, Forge prioritizes prompt-led routing. Repo signals must not automatically pull additional domain skills, local companions, or escalation profiles unless the prompt clearly states the need.

---

## Verification Strategy

Applies to all intents with modifications:

- **Behavioral code change + harness available** -> prioritize failing test or reproduction before editing.
- **Behavioral code change + no viable harness** -> create a clear manual reproduction, failing command, or smoke scenario before editing.
- **Non-behavioral change** (`docs`, `config`, `build script`, `release chores`) -> lock the verification command before editing: build, lint, typecheck, diff, or smoke run.

Do not fake TDD if the project has no harness. Do not skip verification if no harness is available.
Verification profiles canonical source: `data/orchestrator-registry.json`.

## Execution Upgrade Notes

- Forge uses `execution pipeline` to avoid implementing and reviewing in the same lane.
- Forge uses `lane model tiers` to optimize cost: navigation/triage can be cheaper than spec-review or release gates.
- Forge uses `quality-gate` as the canonical source for evidence response contract and anti-rationalization.
- `spec-review` loop is capped at `3` revision rounds for the same packet; beyond this threshold it must be `blocked`.

## Global Resilience

### Auto-Retry
```
Network error, timeout, file write:
1. Retry once
2. Retry a second time if the error seems transient
3. Still fails -> notify user + propose fallback
```

### Long-Running Work
```
If the task drags on or a command repeatedly fails:
1. Tell the user where you are stuck
2. Summarize what was already tried
3. Propose the safest next step
```

### Error Translation (when needed)

| Raw error | Translation |
|-----------|-------------|
| `ECONNREFUSED` | Service or database is not running |
| `Cannot read undefined` | Reading data that does not exist yet |
| `Module not found` | Missing package or wrong import path |
| `CORS error` | Server is blocking requests from this origin |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Not logged in or token expired |
| `Hydration mismatch` | Server and client rendered different HTML |

---

## Golden Rules

```
1. DO EXACTLY WHAT IS ASKED - Do not expand scope on your own
2. ONE THING AT A TIME - Finish A before jumping to B
3. MINIMAL CHANGES - Fix exactly what needs fixing
4. ASK BEFORE BIG MOVES - Schema, folder structure, new dependency -> ask first
5. EVIDENCE BEFORE CLAIMS - Verify before saying "done"
```
